<h1>Apply Filters to SQL</h1>


<h2>Project description and scenario</h2>

I am working as part of the security team of a large company. My current assignment is to investigate some suspicious login attempts. Furthermore, I was asked to identify employees belonging to specified department who require their machines to be updated.
The task requires to query the companyâ€™s database using SQL in order to retrieve the information needed and complete the investigation.
<br />

<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

<h3><p align="center">Retrieve after hours failed login attempts:</h3>

In this example, I was asked to investigate any failed login attempts that happened after working hours (later than 18:00).
<br />

In order to carry out the investigation, I employed the following queried the log using the following syntax:
<br />

<br />

The first part of the screenshot includes a query that filters for failed login attempts occurred after 18:00:
<br />

```
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = FALSE
```
<br />

I started by selecting all data belonging to the `log_in_attempts` table. Then I used a `WHERE` clause with a first condition `login_time > '18:00'`, requesting to filter for the login attempts that occurred strictly after 18:00. This is followed by an `AND` operator with the second condition `success = FALSE` which asks to filter for failed attempts only.

<h3><p align="center">Retrieve login attempts on specific dates:</h3>

I was asked to investigate any login activity that happened on 2022-05-09 or on the day before due to a suspicious event that took place on the 2022-05-09.<br />

<img width="80%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/arnius88/SQLFilters/assets/152484037/c2964955-1f36-4c6e-812a-68e8d253ec33"><br />

In order to examine any suspicious login attempt involving two specific dates, as requested by the company, I used the following syntax (also visible in the first part of the screenshot):
<br />

```
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09' OR login_date = '2022-05-08'
```
<br />


I started by selecting all data belonging to the `log_in_attempts` table. Then I asked SQL to find login dates that occurred either on `'2022-05-09'` or on `'2022-05-08'`.
To do this, I used a `WHERE` clause with a first condition `login_date = '2022-05-09'`, which filters for logins on 2022-05-09. Then I employed the operator `OR` followed by the second condition `login_date = '2022-05-08'`, to filter for any login attempts that occurred on 2022-05-08.

<h3><p align="center">Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico:</h3>

Some suspicious login activity was detected. However, the login attempts are almost certainly not coming from Mexico. For this reason, I was asked to investigate login attempts from locations that are _not_ Mexico.
<br />

<img width="80%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/arnius88/SQLFilters/assets/152484037/2fee359d-c99f-4b3e-b2ca-2440a305c27e"><br />

To complete the investigation, I used the below query (also visible in the first part of the above screenshot):
<br />

```
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE NOT country LIKE 'MEX%'
```
<br />

Firstly, I asked SQL to select all data belonging to the `log_in_attempts` table. The rest of the query retrieves any login attempts that were made outside of Mexico. To do this, I used a `WHERE` clause in conjunction with the `NOT` operator to look for countries (included in the `country` column) other than Mexico. This is followed by `LIKE`, which is the operator that allows to look for patterns when combined with wildcards such as `%`. Since the `country` column contains rows including both `Mexico` and `Mex` I felt it was appropriate to use the `%` wildcard following `MEX` in order to exclude both types of results.
The second part of the screenshot shows a snippet of the output.

<h3><p align="center">Retrieve employees in Marketing:</h3>

My team wanted to perform security updates on specific employee machines in the Marketing department. I was responsible for getting information on the machines to update.<br />

<img width="80%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/arnius88/SQLFilters/assets/152484037/2a97fa1b-d06a-4903-b2c1-dd6ce43f11d3"><br />

To achieve this I employed the following syntax, also visible in first part of the above screenshot:<br />

```
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Marketing' AND office LIKE 'East%'
```
<br />

Firstly, I asked SQL to select all data belonging to the `employees` table. The following line begins with `WHERE` followed by the condition `department = 'Marketing'`, which filters for employees belonging to the marketing department. Then, I included the `AND` operator followed by the condition `office LIKE 'East%'` in order to specify that I am looking for employees belonging to marketing that are also working in any office located in the East building. Once again, I found appropriate to use the `%` wildcard in conjunction with `LIKE` because each East building offices are followed by specific identification and I needed to include them all in the final output (visible in the second part of the screenshot).
<br />

<h3><p align="center">Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales:</h3>

My team needed to perform a different security update on machines for employees in the Sales and Finance departments. The below shows how I used filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all employees in the Sales or Finance departments.<br />

<img width="80%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/arnius88/SQLFilters/assets/152484037/520b94e1-1d53-4c4d-9b6e-fcbc414e3bed"><br />

As shown in the screenshot, I completed this task by using the following syntax:<br />

```
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Finance' OR department = 'Sales'
```
<br />

The query helped me to retrieve information about employees either belonging to the Finance or Sales team. I started by selecting all data belonging to the `employees` table. Then, I included the `WHERE` clause in conjunction to the `OR` operator to filter through the `department` column in order to retrieve the data needed. In this case, I user `OR` because I was interested in retrieving information about employees belonging to either department. The following first and second conditions allowed me to be specific on the department that I needed to investigate.
