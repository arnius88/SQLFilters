<h1>Apply Filters to SQL</h1>


<h2>Project description and scenario</h2>

I am working as part of the security team of a large company. My current assignment is to investigate some suspicious login attempts. Furthermore, I was asked to identify employees belonging to specified department who require their machines to be updated.
The task requires to query the companyâ€™s database using SQL in order to retrieve the information needed and complete the investigation.
<br />

<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

<h3><p align="center">Retrieve after hours failed login attempts:</h3>

In this example, I was asked to investigate any failed login attempts that happened after working hours (later than 18:00).
<br />

In order to carry out the investigation, I employed the following queried the log using the following syntax:
<br />

<br />

The first part of the screenshot includes a query that filters for failed login attempts occurred after 18:00:
<br />

```
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = FALSE
```
<br />

I started by selecting all data belonging to the `log_in_attempts` table. Then I used a `WHERE` clause with a first condition `login_time > '18:00'`, requesting to filter for the login attempts that occurred strictly after 18:00. This is followed by an `AND` operator with the second condition `success = FALSE` which asks to filter for failed attempts only.

<h3><p align="center">Retrieve login attempts on specific dates:</h3>

I was asked to investigate any login activity that happened on 2022-05-09 or on the day before due to a suspicious event that took place on the 2022-05-09.<br />

In order to examine any suspicious login attempt involving two specific dates, as requested by the company, I used the following syntax (also visible in the first part of the screenshot):
<br />

```
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09' OR login_date = '2022-05-08'
```
<br />


I started by selecting all data belonging to the `log_in_attempts` table. Then I asked SQL to find login dates that occurred either on `'2022-05-09'` or on `'2022-05-08'`.
To do this, I used a `WHERE` clause with a first condition `login_date = '2022-05-09'`, which filters for logins on 2022-05-09. Then I employed the operator `OR` followed by the second condition `login_date = '2022-05-08'`, to filter for any login attempts that occurred on 2022-05-08.
The second part of the screenshot includes a quick view of the output obtained.
